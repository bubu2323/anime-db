This application allows you to show the most popular anime, to search for one by title and to show some random ones. Take advantage of RapidApi's free "Anime db" API.<p>

## About The Project

<p>I decided to carry out this project to improve my Javascript knowledge.
At first I just wanted to take the data from the API and show its content on the page, then add a modal to display the descriptions for each individual anime.
Retrieving data from the API using the fetch was not particularly complicated especially thanks to the exhaustive documentation of the API site. On the contrary, manipulating the data took me some time, particularly when it came to working with objects.
Implementing the modal part was easy, especially thanks to the html tag  `dialog`

Once this part was finished, I decided I wanted to implement the search bar as well and, since I initially thought of making the project only with Javascript, I implemented the function without using a back-end language and therefore I created a function that starts when the user writes the title to search for.
Finally, to hide the API key, I found a solution that sees the use of PHP to store it and pass it to Javascript. This last part took me a long time because I had no knowledge of the security criteria.</p>
